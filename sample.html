Every relationship develops to a place where the things you need most from your partner are the very most difficult things for them to give. At the same time, what they need from you is the hardest for you to give. This happens because most people unconsciously seek a partner who matches unresolved emotional patterns from their past. It is a seeking that can lead to deep healing, but also presents a feeling of crisis.

When your relationship comes to this place of crisis/opportunity, you have three choices: 1) Stay in the relationship and tolerate discomfort without making any change, 2) Work together to support each other while you confront the developmental tasks your relationships is inviting you to overcome or 3) Separate.

We are here to help you work together to overcome the developmental crisis in your relationship and help you experience a corrective emotional experience with your partner. During couples therapy, we are looking for those opportunities to help you restore your emotional connection and sense of empathy for each other. This is less dependent on communication skills and more dependent on the way you listen to each other.

Healthy, stable, successful relationships involve both partners activating a self-management process within the context of the relationship. Effectively, both of you need to be able to separate the ghosts of the past from your present with your partner so that you can hear each other without feeling attacked, belittled or dismissed. The self-management process allows you to hear your partnerâ€™s feelings and respond with empathy and connection while recognizing that those feelings are separate from your own experience.

In addition, you need to learn to: communicate effectively, hear each other through an empathetic lenses, make clear requests and provide feedback in a way that is mutually satisfying.

In intimate relationships more than anywhere else, our past history comes to life disguised within the patterns we develop in newer relationships. At The Center for Healthy Relationships, we use the Imago Therapy strategies developed by Harville Hendrix in combination with an understanding of the characteristics required for a happy, stable relationship which include:

A sense of trust and respect
A feeling of safety
Emotional intimacy and attachment
Friendship
Disagreeing respectfully
Maintaining positive rituals
Being responsive rather than reactive
At The Center for Healthy Relationships, we will support you in developing a safe, healing relationship that allows you to nurture and help each other continue to grow as individuals. We will work diligently with you to help you develop the skills and characteristics necessary for a happy, stable relationship.
